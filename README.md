About Northwestern University's M.S. Data Science Program
MSDS students gain critical skills for succeeding in today's data-intensive world. They learn how to utilize relational and document database systems and analytics software built upon open-source systems such as R, Python, and TensorFlow. They learn how to make trustworthy predictions using traditional statistics and machine learning methods.

MSDS faculty members include data scientists, professional researchers and consultants, social scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists. Most faculty members hold terminal doctoral degrees and have extensive teaching and business experience.
